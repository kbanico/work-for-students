                    Have students perform a small project to make a title screen
                    
                    Imagine you are part of a team of developers that is coding a new game
                    Your task is to make a title screen for a game called 
                    
                        'SUPER MARIO KONG'
                    
                    
                    *things that needs to be in the game*
                    - A background image 
                    - The title of the game
                    - The name of your company (name it whatever you want)
                    - A Touch To Start String
                    
                    
                    - the title needs to be in the center of the game 
                    - the company name needs to be write below the title
                    - The company name needs to be smaller than the title and your boss wants it in a nice purple color
                    - Lastly he wants you to add a `Touch Screen To Play` somewhere in the game
                    - the `Touch Screen To Play` needs to be bigger than the company name but smaller than the title
                    
                    
                    -You can look for nice background images on the internet and drop it into this folder
                    -If we have time you can also draw a character or use any character from internet and 
                     put it in your project
                    
                */
